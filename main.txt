In short, k8s is a framework for deploying servers and it comes with 
lots of tooling that is needed to maintain services.

Wikipedia: 
Kubernetes (commonly known as k8s) is an open-source container-
orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, 
scaling, and management.
Container in this context is a OS-level virtualization in which the 
kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user space instances. 
Orchestration refers to aligning the business request with applications, 
data, and infrastructure.
